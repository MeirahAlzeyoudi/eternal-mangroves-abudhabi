##  Project Overview

This project aimed to analyze and visualize the evolution of Abu Dhabi’s mangrove forests from 2018 to 2024. The objective was to assess CO₂ reduction through mangrove health monitoring using remote sensing and artificial intelligence. Our methodology combines advanced GIS, machine learning, and temporal satellite data processing.

##  Goals

- Generate comprehensive multidimensional raster data (temperature, methane, CO₂, oxygen).
- Conduct rigorous analysis of CO₂ reduction using satellite imagery.
- Visualize environmental change over time using NDVI and false-color imagery.
- Apply AI to assess mangrove health and expansion potential.
- Estimate areas suitable for mangrove restoration and protection.
- Promote sustainable, data-driven environmental planning.

##  AI & Machine Learning Tools

- **NDVI Analysis** using Sentinel-2 imagery
- **U-Net** model for pixel-level mangrove health classification
- **Random Forest Classifier** to compare healthy vs. stressed regions
- **Time-series Analysis** for emission and vegetation change
- **False-color Image Processing** to improve NDVI sensitivity
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, rasterio, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

##  Satellite & Data Sources

- **Sentinel-2** (Optical) — NDVI and false-color analysis
- **Sentinel Hub** — Cloud-free imagery processing
- **Google Earth Engine** — Multi-date vegetation analysis

##  Tools & Platforms

- **Google Earth Engine** — Time-lapse visualization and remote sensing analysis
- **Python (Google Colab)** — Machine learning model training & data processing
- **QGIS & GDAL** — Raster operations, DEM clipping Classification, zonal statistics, NDVI, and 3D modeling

##  Results

- Achieved **92% classification accuracy** in detecting healthy vs. stressed mangroves using fused SAR and optical data.
- Mapped mangrove health transitions from 2018 to 2024:
  - **2018:** 48.95% Healthy | 51.05% Medium Health
  - **2024:** 83.07% Healthy | 16.93% Medium Health
- **Percentage Improvement:** 45.95%  
  **Percentage Deterioration:** 30.53%  
  **Average Change:** 15.41%
- 2024 Area of Interest (AOI): **9.24 km²**
  - Healthy Mangroves: **2.59 km²**
  - Medium Health Mangroves: **0.53 km²**
- Estimated **Carbon Sequestration** from healthy mangroves:  
  **~300,000 tonnes/km² → Total: 777,000 t/year**
- Generated **false-color NDVI composites**, **3D terrain visualizations**, and **zonal statistics** to assess change patterns.
- Produced a **historical temperature map** to identify optimal growth conditions and guide future afforestation efforts.
- Developed **AI-driven pixel-level approach** for health change detection, CO₂ modeling, and conservation targeting.

> This analysis directly supports mangrove sustainability planning through spatial intelligence, environmental modeling, and carbon offset quantification.
